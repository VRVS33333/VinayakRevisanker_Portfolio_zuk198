Libraries
```{r}
set.seed(200)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```



```{r}
Deaths = read.csv("Provisional_COVID-19_Deaths__Focus_on_Ages_0-18_Years.csv", header=TRUE)
dplyr::glimpse(Deaths)
```



Shows the the total amount of deaths from covid between ages 0-18
```{r}
result = Deaths %>% 
  group_by(Age = as.factor(Age.group)) %>% 
  summarize(Total = sum(COVID.19.Deaths)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Total)) %>% 
  filter(Age != "19-44 years") %>% 
  filter(Age != "45-64 years") %>% 
  filter(Age != "65-74 years") %>% 
  filter(Age != "75 years and over") %>% 
  top_n(10, wt = Total)

ggplot(result, aes(x=Age, y=Total))+
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "Purple")
```

Seperating Race 

```{r}
Deaths = Deaths %>%  filter(Race.or.Hispanic.Origin.Group == "Non-Hispanic Asian")
summary(Deaths)
```


```{r}

ggplot(Deaths, aes(x = Start.Week, y = COVID.19.Deaths))+
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "Purple")
